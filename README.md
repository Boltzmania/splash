Description
-----------
This program is rather useless. It's the functional equivalent of the Walmart
greeter. It's here to say, "Hi how are ya?" before sending you into the wild
wasteland of the terminal. It also gives the date, the time, and a nice little
splash text to put some pep in your step.

The messages in splashes.txt are personal to me. They include epigrams,
programming quotes, sayings, and pop cultural references that I like from
movies/books/games/websites/etc.

Customization
-------------
To personalize your own login greetings just edit the *splashes.txt* file. Or
create your own. It's not like I worked really hard on mine or anything. The
file *splash.sh* has instrustions for adding quotes. You can also change the
greeting. Go hack away at it.

Installation
------------
Leave the files where they are or move them to your favorite location. Either
works.

Running
-------
Run this command in your sh profile:

```sh
$ /path/to/splash.sh /path/to/splashes.txt
```

This profile is different for different shells although .profile is recommended
for all.

| shell | file |
| -------- | -------- |
| bash | .bash_profile |
| csh/ksh/sh | .profile |
| zsh | .zprofile |

TODO
----
- [ ] Add more splashes
- [ ] Add moar splashes
- [ ] Change up the greeting. Make it more customizable.
- [ ] Possibly rename script to spla.sh?
- [ ] Possibly add ascii logo?
- [ ] MOHR splashes - can't go wrong here

License
-------
Uhhhh I copied this set of headings from another project. Does this really need
a license? It's ~15 whole lines of code barely more complicated than "Hello
World!". If you manage to break something with that I'd be truly impressed.

Why are you still reading this?
